# Leaflet Challenge: Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization

This challenge involves developing an interactive map using **Leaflet** to visualize real-time earthquake data provided by the **United States Geological Survey (USGS)**. The objective is to create a meaningful and dynamic visualization to educate the public and government organizations about seismic activities and tectonic plates.

## Background

The USGS gathers a vast amount of global earthquake data, updated frequently. However, they lack an interactive method to display this information. This tool is designed to:
- Illustrate the magnitude and depth of earthquakes.
- Educate users about tectonic plate boundaries and seismic activity.
- Provide insights through customizable map layers and legends.

## Features

### Part 1: Earthquake Visualization
- **Earthquake Markers**:
  - Marker size correlates with the magnitude of the earthquake.
  - Marker color indicates the depth of the earthquake.
- **Interactive Popups**: Display key details, such as magnitude and location, on marker click.
- **Legend**: Provides a clear context for the magnitude and depth of earthquakes.

### Part 2 (Optional): Adding Tectonic Plate Data
- **Overlay Layers**:
  - Include tectonic plate boundaries alongside earthquake data.
  - Toggle overlays on/off independently.
- **Base Maps**: Offer multiple map style options.
- **Layer Controls**: Enhance user interaction by switching datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Leaflet**: Interactive maps.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic and data processing.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend structure and styling.
- **GeoJSON**: Earthquake and tectonic plate data format.
